In this project I am looking at a [dataset of Epicurious recipes](https://www.kaggle.com/hugodarwood/epirecipes). This dataset has over 600 variables and contains nutritional information and recipe tags, such as "vegan", "christmas" or "dessert". I use regularized regressions (lasso and ridge) and XGBoost to predict the ratings of the recipes.

Methods used: XGBoost, Lasso, Ridge 

Packages used: numpy, pandas, sklearn, xgboost, seaborn
