# DataScienceProjects

Projects for the purpose of learning and practicing data science.

## [Optimal seating arrangement](https://github.com/MateVaradi/DataScienceProjects/tree/master/OptimalSeating)
How can we seat the guests of a wedding optimally?

Project inspired by [Bellows, M., & Peterson, J. L. (2012)](https://www.improbable.com/news/2012/Optimal-seating-chart.pdf)

## [Geospatial analysis of New York City Airbnb data and price predictions](https://github.com/MateVaradi/DataScienceProjects/tree/master/Geospatial-Analysis-NYC-Airbnb)
How does the distance from the most popular tourist attractions affect the price of an Airbnb in New York City? Can we use variables like this to improve price predictions?

A project created after finishing the Kaggle Learn Course on [Geospatial Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/geospatial-analysis).

## [Predicting recipe ratings with XGBoost, Lasso and Ridge](https://github.com/MateVaradi/DataScienceProjects/tree/master/Predicting-Recipe-Ratings)
Curious about Epicurious recipe ratings? 

A project to practice dealing with high-dimensional data and the use of XGBoost.

## [NLP Classification of real and fake disaster tweets](https://github.com/MateVaradi/DataScienceProjects/tree/master/RealOrNot?)
Can an algorithm differentiate between "It's a disaster, they dropped a bomb on the city" and "It's a disaster, I dropped my avocado toast on the floor"?

Solutions to a [Kaggle practice competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/overview) inspired by what I learned in the [NLP specialization of deeplearning.ai on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing). 


## [Recognizing clothing items with convolutional neural networks](https://github.com/MateVaradi/DataScienceProjects/tree/master/Fashion-MNIST)
It's a coat...It's a shirt...It's a pullover?

A mini project after finishing the Kaggle Learn Course on [Deep Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-deep-learning). I run a simple convolutional neural network model on the Fashion MNIST dataset by Zalando.
