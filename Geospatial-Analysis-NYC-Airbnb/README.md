In this small project I am looking the the [New York City Airbnb dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data/notebooks). 
I build on what I learned from the [Kaggle Learn course on Geospatial Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/geospatial-analysis).
After analyzing the data, I create and use geospatial variables, such as distance from popular NYC sights to predict listing price. 

To have a look at the Jupyter Notebook that contains the analysis and displays the interactive maps, please go to [this link]( https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MateVaradi/DataScienceProjects/blob/master/Geospatial-Analysis-NYC-Airbnb/NYC%20Airbnb%20%28geospatial%29%20data%20analysis%20and%20price%20prediction.ipynb). (This is the nbviewer view of the .ipynb file of this repository. GitHub cannot natively display folium maps.)
